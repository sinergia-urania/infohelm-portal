# Weekly Horoscope: November 23–30, 2025

The Sun and Mars in Sagittarius bring a faster pace, more optimism and a need to see the bigger picture. This fiery duo awakens the desire for freedom, travel, learning and honest conversations – but also a tendency to rush into things. Many will feel they "can’t stand still anymore" and must take a risk in order to move forward.

Mercury and Venus in deep Scorpio amplify intuition, magnetism and the need to go all the way in relationships – no half-measures. In love, finances and important talks, honesty and discretion are required. Jupiter in Cancer highlights stories about family, home and emotional security, while Saturn and Neptune in Pisces wrap up old cycles and help us release what has been draining us for a long time.

During the week the Moon moves through Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces – from seriousness and responsibility, through the need for freedom, to emotional release and cleansing. It’s an ideal time to finish obligations, open up to new ideas and then reward yourself with rest and quiet.

> **Note:** This horoscope is for entertainment and informational purposes only.  
> For serious life decisions, always rely on your own judgment and personal discernment.

## ♈ Aries

**Love:** The Sun and Mars form a harmonious aspect with your sign and bring more passion as well as honesty. Single Aries can meet someone through travel, online platforms or courses. Those in a relationship should start an open conversation about the future of the partnership – your partner wants clarity, not just action.

**Career and money:** This is a great week for anything related to foreign contacts, education or expanding your business. You may get a chance to do something new or to improve your skills. Watch impulsive spending – you can easily go over budget, especially on tech or trips.

**Health and energy:** Your energy is strong, but there is a risk of overexertion. Don’t push yourself past your limits, especially in physical activities or sports. Short breaks and stretching can make a big difference.

**Tip for the week:** Take risks – but with a plan. Enthusiasm + strategy = a winning combination.

---

## ♉ Taurus

**Love:** Venus in Scorpio opposite your sign intensifies emotions but can also bring drama in relationships. Old stories about jealousy, possessiveness or trust may resurface. Single Taureans can step into an intense, magnetic connection that completely pulls them out of their comfort zone.

**Career and money:** Uranus in your sign still pushes you toward change – you may suddenly get tired of doing things the old way or realize you deserve better conditions. Money matters need caution: watch shared finances, loans or debts, and read all the fine print in contracts.

**Health and energy:** You need a calmer rhythm and quality sleep. Emotional tension may show up in your stomach, neck and back. Help yourself with walks, massage or spending time in nature.

**Tip for the week:** Don’t be afraid of change – be more afraid of staying stuck in what no longer fits you.

---

## ♊ Gemini

**Love:** The focus is on partnerships – the Sun and Mars are moving through your relationship sector and put a spotlight on everything that works or doesn’t work between you and another person. Single Geminis can attract someone direct, witty and unfiltered. Couples may argue more but also have a chance to reach a deeper level of intimacy through honest dialogue.

**Career and money:** Partnerships and teamwork are crucial. Someone may offer you a joint project or help you promote your ideas. Finances are steady if you avoid wasting money on small, impulsive purchases and random online shopping.

**Health and energy:** Your mind is hyperactive, so your body may ask for extra rest. Take care of your nervous system – less screen time before bed, more movement during the day.

**Tip for the week:** Words have power – choose them so they build, not break.

---

## ♋ Cancer

**Love:** Jupiter in your sign increases the need for warmth and true closeness. It’s a favorable period for family, shared plans and strengthening bonds. Single Cancers can meet someone through family, friends or a small get-together at home – someone who feels "familiar" from the first moment.

**Career and money:** Work requires more organization and routine. You may feel you’re doing more than others, but this can later come back to you as recognition or a better offer. Watch expenses related to home, renovation or family – the limit can easily disappear from sight.

**Health and energy:** You need a balance between work and rest. Pay attention to your stomach, diet and sleep habits. More warm meals and fewer sudden schedule changes would do your body good.

**Tip for the week:** Take care of yourself the way you take care of everyone else – that’s not selfish, that’s healthy.

---

## ♌ Leo

**Love:** The Sun and Mars in Sagittarius create a strong fire trine to your sign – this is a week for sparks, flirting, fun and romantic gestures. If you’re coupled, revive your rituals: a date, a trip, a movie, lots of laughter. Single Leos shine wherever they go.

**Career and money:** Creative projects, public appearances, marketing and anything that needs charisma are favored. You have more confidence to show what you can do. Finances can improve if you bravely ask for what your work is worth and stop undervaluing yourself.

**Health and energy:** Energy is high, but you can easily burn out if you do everything in "fifth gear." You need physical activity, but also time to relax your heart and mind.

**Tip for the week:** Remember: no one can dim your light – except you, if you stop believing in yourself.

---

## ♍ Virgo

**Love:** Emotions run deep, but you may not want to show all of them. Conversations can move toward serious topics – trust, boundaries, shared future. Single Virgos may feel drawn to someone sharp-minded, intelligent and a bit mysterious.

**Career and money:** Focus is on home, family obligations and practical matters. You may be juggling private and work tasks more than usual. Financially it’s wise to create a plan and cut unnecessary expenses.

**Health and energy:** Your body reacts to stress through tension in the stomach, intestines or skin. A light detox routine, more water and less coffee could do wonders. Don’t ignore your body’s signals.

**Tip for the week:** You don’t have to control everything – sometimes doing your best and letting go is enough.

---

## ♎ Libra

**Love:** Venus in Scorpio brings passion and a strong need to feel valued and safe in relationships. You may open topics around shared finances, investments or long-term plans. Single Libras may fall for someone with a strong personality and magnetic energy.

**Career and money:** Communication, contracts, short trips and meetings are in the spotlight. It’s a good time for negotiations, but try not to idealize the other side. Finances can improve through side gigs, freelance work or a better distribution of income.

**Health and energy:** You need more movement and less sitting. Short walks, bike rides or light yoga will help you unwind both body and mind.

**Tip for the week:** Don’t apologize for having needs – balance starts with respecting yourself.

---

## ♏ Scorpio

**Love:** Mercury and Venus in your sign amplify your charisma, attractiveness and power of words. You read between the lines and see what’s really happening in relationships. It’s a great period to finally talk about what’s been bothering you, but be careful not to slide into control games or "testing" your partner.

**Career and money:** The focus is on income, talents and security. You may get a chance to better monetize your skills or start a project that brings long-term stability. Be cautious with secret deals and confidential information – protect sensitive data.

**Health and energy:** Emotions are intense, so you need an outlet – sports, creativity, meditation. Pay attention to hormones, sleep and overall regeneration.

**Tip for the week:** Your strength is that you can "dive deep" – just remember to come up for air now and then.

---

## ♐ Sagittarius

**Love:** The Sun and Mars in your sign put you center stage. You radiate confidence, so if you’re single, you attract new people with ease. Coupled Sagittarians may crave more freedom and spontaneity in love; it’s important your partner understands this is not running away, but a need for livelier energy.

**Career and money:** This is your time to take initiative. Launch projects, apply for positions, talk to influential people. It’s a good moment to set goals for the next 12 months. Money follows your courage – those who dare to ask for more have a better chance to get it.

**Health and energy:** Your energy is strong but can be scattered. Try to maintain a basic routine – sleep, food, some movement. Pay attention to knees, hips and liver.

**Tip for the week:** Big stories begin with a single "yes" – say it where you truly want to grow.

---

## ♑ Capricorn

**Love:** You’re more emotional than you may appear on the surface, and this week can bring back themes from the past. People with unfinished business may reappear, along with that "what if" feeling. Coupled Capricorns might not be very vocal, but will show love through actions.

**Career and money:** The Moon in your sign at the beginning of the week highlights responsibility, deadlines and duties. You have a chance to stand out through professionalism and persistence. Finances are stable if you stay disciplined – no need for risky moves.

**Health and energy:** Fatigue builds up more easily, so don’t postpone rest until "everything is done." Take care of bones, joints and spine. Gentle stretching and good posture help more than you think.

**Tip for the week:** Strength is not in carrying everything alone – it’s in knowing when to ask for support.

---

## ♒ Aquarius

**Love:** The Moon in your sign mid-week brings emotional refreshment. You crave freedom, friends and people you can talk to openly and casually. In relationships it’s important to have space for your ideas and projects – you don’t handle suffocation well.

**Career and money:** New plans, group projects and online collaborations are on the way. Good ideas easily find support if you present them clearly. Financial changes may come through teamwork, startup-style projects or technology.

**Health and energy:** Your energy comes in waves – at one moment you’re full of drive, the next you don’t feel like doing anything. Find your own rhythm and don’t give in to external pressure. Your nervous system needs breaks from information and screens.

**Tip for the week:** Surround yourself with people who don’t dim your originality, but amplify it.

---

## ♓ Pisces

**Love:** Saturn and Neptune in your sign, together with the Moon spending the end of the week in Pisces, bring a wave of emotions and a need for silence. You’ll clearly see who truly understands you and who only loves the idea of you. Single Pisces can feel a special pull toward someone who seems like a "soulmate" or an artistic spirit.

**Career and money:** Work may require more responsibility and focus on practical steps, even though you’d rather be floating in imagination. The good news is you can blend creativity and realism – especially in art, helping others, spiritual work or counseling. Finances need a sober look, not idealization.

**Health and energy:** Your sensitivity – both physical and emotional – is heightened. Boundaries are crucial: how much you give to others and how much you keep for yourself. More sleep, time near water and music can be real therapy.

**Tip for the week:** Dream big, but walk step by step – that’s how dreams become part of everyday life.
