You don’t need to throw your phone into a river to feel better. You just need to cut down the “micro-interruptions” that turn your day into constant attention-switching.

This is a 7-day mini challenge. Each day you do one small thing. Total time: 5–10 minutes.

## Day 1: Mute everything that isn’t a human

Keep notifications only for:
- calls and messages from people (your choice),
- your calendar,
- your bank (if you want).

Mute everything else.  
Don’t delete apps—just stop the constant pinging.

## Day 2: One phone, one “home”

Pick one place where your phone “lives” while you work or relax (a shelf, desk corner, drawer).  
The point is to stop it from living in your hand or right in front of your face.

Bonus: place it face down.

## Day 3: Clean up your home screen

Make the first screen boring.

- keep 6–12 essential apps max,
- put everything else into folders or on a second screen.

When the “menu” is crowded, your brain keeps choosing—and that’s exhausting.

## Day 4: Two check-ins per day

Instead of checking everything 50 times:
- once late morning (e.g., 11:30),
- once in the evening (e.g., 18:00).

If you feel nervous about it, set a 10-minute timer and “close the shop” when it rings.  
Small trick, huge difference.

## Day 5: 60 minutes screen-free before bed

It doesn’t have to be perfect. Just 60 minutes without:
- scrolling,
- news feeds,
- random YouTube/shorts loops.

Try instead:
- a shower,
- calm music,
- a book,
- prepping for tomorrow (clothes/coffee/to-do list).

This is the “hardest” day—but it gives the biggest energy return.

## Day 6: One focus block of 25 minutes

Set a 25-minute timer and do one thing:
- one email / one proposal,
- one piece of writing,
- one task.

Phone isn’t in your hand. Ideally it’s in another room.

If that feels too hard, start with 15 minutes. The key is having a block.

## Day 7: The weekly rule that keeps the results

Pick the easiest rule that worked for you and keep it long-term, like:
- “Notifications OFF except people”
- “Phone stays out of bed”
- “Two social check-ins per day”
- “One focus block daily”

You don’t need 7 habits. One habit that works is enough.

## Conclusion

The goal isn’t to become a “digital monk.” It’s to get back the feeling that *you* run your day—not your screen.

If after 7 days you feel even 10% calmer, the challenge worked.
