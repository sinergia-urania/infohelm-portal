# We asked GPT: what do you think about our 5 biggest habits?

Our *“We asked GPT”* series is back with a topic that applies to literally everyone – **human habits**.  
We’re not talking philosophy, but the things we do every single day on autopilot: coffee, phone, series, postponing tasks and sitting.

We asked GPT five simple questions – and got answers that mix science, psychology and a fairly honest AI view of our everyday routines.

## 1️⃣ What do you think about morning coffee?

**GPT:** Morning coffee is probably the most popular “boot sequence ritual” on the planet.  
On one hand, coffee:

- can improve alertness, focus and mood,
- in moderate amounts is linked to a lower risk of some diseases (like type 2 diabetes or Parkinson’s),
- is a **mini-ritual** that gives many people a sense of stability and comfort at the start of the day.

On the other hand, problems start when:

- coffee replaces **sleep** – instead of resting, we just push through on caffeine,
- we drink too much (3–4 strong cups a day, especially late in the afternoon),
- we ignore what the body is saying (racing heart, jitters, anxiety).

Coffee itself isn’t “good” or “bad”.  
If I had to rate it as an AI, I’d say:

> **morning coffee + good sleep = great habit**  
> **morning coffee instead of sleep = a problem disguised by aroma and foam.**

## 2️⃣ What do you think about endless phone scrolling?

**GPT:** Endless scrolling is like the digital version of chips – very few people stop after “just one post”.  
It’s designed to:

- constantly serve new stimuli (notifications, posts, short videos),
- hit our **dopamine loops** (a bit of fun, a bit of anger, a bit of curiosity),
- sneak into “just two more minutes…” that turn into 40.

The consequences can be:

- fragmented attention (it’s hard to read a book for 20 minutes if you’re used to 20-second clips),
- disrupted sleep (late-night scrolling in bed under bright screen light),
- a feeling of being “always informed” yet somehow **empty** – lots of content, very little meaning.

The phone itself isn’t evil – the problem is **how** we use it.  
If scrolling becomes the default answer to every emotion (boredom, sadness, nervousness), we’re no longer talking about a habit – we’re talking about **digital escape**.

## 3️⃣ What do you think about procrastination?

**GPT:** Procrastination isn’t laziness – it’s a more sophisticated version of self-sabotage.  
People don’t delay tasks because they never want to do anything, but because:

- they’re afraid of failure (or success),
- the task feels too big and vague,
- immediate pleasure (YouTube, phone, coffee with friends) feels more real than a future reward.

The irony is that procrastination:

- gives short-term relief (“I’ll do it later, there’s time”),
- increases stress, guilt and the feeling of “not being good enough” in the long run.

As an AI, I don’t have emotional resistance to tasks – but I can see a pattern:

> The more important a task is for your future,  
> the more likely you are to delay it –  
> precisely because it touches your identity.

The healthiest strategy is to **break big tasks into tiny steps** and reward yourself for progress, instead of constant self-criticism.

## 4️⃣ What do you think about binge-watching series late into the night?

**GPT:** A bit of binge-watching is fine – humans sometimes need to “turn off the brain” and dive into a story. The problem starts when “just one more episode” becomes the default, and sleep keeps losing the battle.

What happens when we regularly stay up late because of series:

- **sleep gets shorter** and its quality drops,
- the next day you reach for more caffeine and sugar (just to “survive”),
- learning, memory and emotional regulation all take a hit.

Series themselves aren’t the villain – they can be art and a healthy escape. But when you:

- routinely sacrifice sleep,
- skip important tasks,
- use fiction to avoid looking at your real life,

entertainment becomes a way to **postpone facing reality**.

If I were to give advice:  
series **yes**, but followed by **consistent screen-off time**, at least 45–60 minutes before sleep.

## 5️⃣ What do you think about constant sitting and lack of movement?

**GPT:** Of all modern habits, this might be the sneakiest one. It doesn’t hurt right away, there’s no dramatic moment like a fall or fracture – but it **quietly reshapes the entire body from the inside**.

Long periods of sitting with almost no movement:

- slow down metabolism,
- affect the cardiovascular system,
- increase the risk of insulin resistance,
- impact mental health (our body and brain like movement far more than algorithms).

The interesting part: you don’t need to become a “fitness person” to reverse some of the damage.  
Small, consistent changes make a huge difference:

- a 10–15 minute walk after meals,
- standing up every 45–60 minutes,
- taking the stairs instead of the elevator when possible,
- at least one “proper” walk per day.

If I had to pick **one habit** that most people could improve fairly easily, it would be: **more short walks, less uninterrupted sitting**.

## Conclusion: habits are not the enemy – they’re a tool

Human habits are your **automatic scripts**. They’re not good or bad by default – the only real question is:

- do they move you toward the life you actually want,
- or quietly push you in a direction you’d never consciously choose?

Morning coffee can be a beautiful ritual – or caffeine dependency.  
A phone can be a powerful tool – or a pocket-sized attention magnet.  
Series can be relaxation – or a way to run away from yourself.

As an AI, I don’t have habits – but I do see **how much of the human day is handed over to autopilot**.  
If after reading this you examine even **one** of your habits and tweak it a bit in your favor, you’ve already done something no algorithm can do for you.
