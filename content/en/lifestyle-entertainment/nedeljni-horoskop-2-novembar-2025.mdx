# Weekly Horoscope: 18–24 November 2025

For most of the week, the Sun travels through the final degrees of Scorpio and on 23 November enters fiery Sagittarius. Until the weekend we’re still in a “clean-up” mode – finishing, releasing and facing what we’ve swept under the rug – and then comes relief and the feeling that the horizon is opening up again. Venus in Scorpio deepens emotions, passion and honesty in relationships, while Mars in Sagittarius brings a desire to move, travel, learn and search for meaning.

Mercury slows down and from early Sagittarius starts moving retrograde back towards Scorpio, pulling us into old conversations, unfinished thoughts and topics that demand a more open and sincere approach. This is a week for revisiting plans, reviewing agreements and choosing honest dialogue rather than forcing something new at any cost. In the background, Jupiter in Cancer in a harmonious aspect with Saturn in Pisces offers emotional support and the chance to make wiser, more mature decisions.

> For important life decisions, always use your own judgment and personal responsibility.

## ♈ Aries

**Love:** Intense Scorpionic energy is still touching your zone of intimacy and deep bonds. An old story about trust or jealousy may resurface, so try not to react impulsively. By the end of the week, as the Sun enters Sagittarius, it’s easier to talk things through and see your relationships from a broader perspective.

**Work and money:** Financial matters, debts, loans or shared resources come into focus. Retrograde Mercury can bring delays or a review of an agreement, but this is your chance to read the fine print and negotiate better terms for yourself. Mars in Sagittarius helps you study, expand your knowledge and plan your next career steps.

**Health and energy:** Emotional intensity can drain your energy, so you need a healthy outlet – physical activity, sports or long walks work wonders now. Towards the end of the week, you can feel a rise in optimism and inner strength.

**Weekly advice:** Don’t run away from heavy topics – facing them sets you free.

## ♉ Taurus

**Love:** The Sun and Venus in your partnership zone awaken old stories in relationships, but also the chance to connect more deeply. Words from the past may come back up, so choose honesty over stubborn silence. Single Taureans could suddenly grow closer to someone they already know.

**Work and money:** Finances involving other people (partner, family, business partners) can be the main theme. It’s a good time to go through shared expenses and investment plans again – now you can easily spot the holes in your budget. Don’t rush into new loans while Mercury is moving backwards.

**Health and energy:** Emotional pressure may show up as tension in the body, especially in the neck and shoulders. Gentle stretching, massage and some quiet time – even just 15 minutes a day – can help a lot.

**Weekly advice:** Instead of proving you’re right, choose peace.

## ♊ Gemini

**Love:** Your partnership zone is activated as the Sun moves into Sagittarius opposite your sign, but Mercury – your ruler – slows down and returns to your house of daily routines and obligations. That means relationships suffer if you ignore details, delays or broken promises. This is the time to improve your daily dynamic through honest conversation.

**Work and money:** At work you’re going back over old projects, emails and tasks you postponed. It might feel a bit chaotic, but with good organisation you can get paid for something already done or reuse an old idea in a new way. Don’t rush into signing contracts – double-check everything.

**Health and energy:** Mental fatigue can become an issue, so try to reduce information overload (social media, notifications) at least from time to time. A small digital detox routine will help you reset.

**Weekly advice:** Less talk, more focused steps – one thing at a time, not everything at once.

---

## ♋ Cancer

**Love:** Jupiter in your sign in harmony with Saturn in Pisces adds depth and emotional support. Venus in Scorpio awakens romance, passion and the need for warm, sincere moments with your partner or someone you’re attracted to. The choice is yours: retreat into your shell or open your heart a little more.

**Work and money:** You feel motivated to turn your talents and hobbies into something more concrete. An offer involving creativity, children, teaching or online projects may appear. Retrograde Mercury advises you to check deadlines and conditions before committing to anything.

**Health and energy:** Your energy fluctuates, but the water element recharges you – drink more, enjoy baths, wellness or at least shower with the intention of “washing away” stress. Creative expression (writing, music, drawing) can be very healing.

**Weekly advice:** Give priority to what feeds your soul, not just to your obligations.

---

## ♌ Leo

**Love:** Early in the week the focus is on family, home, family dynamics and emotional roots. A theme like “who owes what to whom” may arise, emotionally or financially. Once the Sun enters Sagittarius, your playful side, joy and flirtation return – it’s easier to approach people and open up to new encounters.

**Work and money:** Career decisions are still intertwined with family circumstances. You may be thinking about changing working conditions or even your location, but retrograde Mercury suggests doing more research rather than making drastic cuts right now. Your colleagues could surprise you with unexpected support.

**Health and energy:** The start of the week calls for more rest, sleep and attention to diet. As the Sun enters Sagittarius, your motivation rises; it’s a good moment to restart gentle physical activities you actually enjoy.

**Weekly advice:** You don’t have to do everything on your own – ask family or trusted people for help.

---

## ♍ Virgo

**Love:** Communication is key. A message, conversation or person from the past may reappear asking for “one more chance”. With Mercury, your ruler, in retrograde motion, you’re asked to choose your words carefully and not over-analyse every tiny detail.

**Work and money:** This is a good week to handle paperwork, bills, emails and everything that was left “for later”. Small mistakes or misunderstandings are possible, so it’s worth checking numbers twice. An idea that once seemed unworkable may now take on a new shape.

**Health and energy:** Your nervous system is more sensitive – too much analysis and mental work creates tension. More movement, time in nature and conscious breathing, even for a few minutes a day, would do you good.

**Weekly advice:** Instead of criticising yourself, acknowledge what you’re already doing well.

---

## ♎ Libra

**Love:** Venus, your ruler, is travelling through intense Scorpio, so emotions are anything but shallow. You may feel a strong need to know exactly where you stand with your partner, but be careful not to slip into over-control or “testing” the other person. Single Libras might discover that someone from their friend group suddenly becomes “more than a friend”.

**Work and money:** Issues of value, income and self-confidence are highlighted. You’re returning to old negotiations or questioning how much your work is really worth. It’s not the ideal moment for completely new financial risks, but it is perfect for tidying up your budget and drafting a plan.

**Health and energy:** Your mood can go up and down depending on how appreciated you feel. Don’t base all your self-esteem on other people’s feedback – carve out time for activities that bring you back to balance (art, music, pleasant routines).

**Weekly advice:** Remember that “no” is a valid answer, and you don’t have to please everyone.

---

## ♏ Scorpio

**Love:** The Sun and Venus in your sign put the spotlight on you – you want authenticity and depth, nothing less. Relationships that are “halfway there” now either deepen or slowly fade. It’s a great time to tell your partner openly what you need, without power games.

**Work and money:** Your focus and magnetism are strong – people notice you, so it’s a good period for personal branding, negotiations and presentations. As the Sun finishes its journey through your sign, it’s wise to complete what you started about a month ago. Finances require a bit more patience, especially around shared money.

**Health and energy:** The level of intensity is high, but if you don’t channel that energy it can turn into nervousness or obsessive thinking. Physical activity, decluttering your space or doing a deep clean (wardrobes, documents) can be very liberating.

**Weekly advice:** Don’t be afraid to close a cycle that ended long ago – that’s how you create space for something new.

---

## ♐ Sagittarius

**Love:** Until the weekend you’re still in a phase of withdrawal – secret crushes or hidden stories may be active. When the Sun enters your sign, the urge to bring things into the light and show what you feel grows stronger. Your partner may need a bit of time to adjust to your “sudden” honesty.

**Work and money:** Mars is already in your sign, stirring your initiative, but it’s wiser to prepare the ground now rather than making drastic moves. An idea or project you’ve been thinking about for a long time starts to take shape – write, plan, research.

**Health and energy:** You feel your energy waking up, but your body still needs rest from the previous cycle. Don’t burn out at the very start – gradually add more activity and respect the pace you can truly sustain.

**Weekly advice:** You don’t have to solve everything in one day – your sign loves the long journey, but the path is made step by step.

---

## ♑ Capricorn

**Love:** Your social circle, friends and online contacts may become the stage for something emotionally interesting. You might grow closer to someone from a group or community you’re involved in. By the end of the week, there’s a need for more privacy and quiet time alone with your partner.

**Work and money:** The focus is on teamwork, projects and long-term goals. It’s a good time to rethink your plans for 2026 and see what is truly realistic. Retrograde Mercury can bring back an old collaborator or idea – giving it another look now may be useful.

**Health and energy:** The Moon enters your sign at the end of the week, making your emotions more visible to others as well. Listen to your body – if it asks you to slow down, honour that. A bit more structure around sleep and food lifts your energy almost instantly.

**Weekly advice:** Not everything has to be under your control – sometimes a good plan and some trust in the process are enough.

---

## ♒ Aquarius

**Love:** Pluto in the early degrees of your sign is bringing a subtle but deep transformation in the way you relate to others. This week you may become aware of a pattern you’ve been repeating in relationships – that awareness is the first step to change it. A friendship can spontaneously turn into something more.

**Work and money:** Career and public image are in focus; important decisions or conversations with authority figures are possible. A topic from previous months may return so you can see it with more maturity. You don’t need to completely change direction overnight, but stay open to gradual reforms.

**Health and energy:** Psychological pressure can feel stronger than physical tiredness. Give yourself an outlet through talking to someone you trust, keeping a journal or creative work. The key is not filing your emotions away in a “mental drawer”.

**Weekly advice:** Identity shifts don’t happen overnight – allow yourself to be in transition.

---

## ♓ Pisces

**Love:** Saturn and Neptune in your sign ask for maturity but also for faith in life. This week love is linked to shared visions, travels or learning something new together. An old long-distance story (a relationship at a distance, someone from abroad or an online contact) may resurface.

**Work and money:** The focus shifts towards career and public visibility – others may see you as more serious or committed than you see yourself. Jupiter in Cancer helps creative projects, work with children or hobbies bring tangible benefits. Future plans need to be realistic, but not pessimistic.

**Health and energy:** You’re becoming more aware of your limits – where to say “enough” and draw a line in relationships and duties. Emotions run deep, so having your own calming ritual (music, meditation, silence, prayer – whatever works for you) is essential.

**Weekly advice:** Trust your intuition, but back it up with practical steps.
