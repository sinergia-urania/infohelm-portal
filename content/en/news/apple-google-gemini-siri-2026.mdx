# Apple and Google sign an AI deal: Gemini to power the next Siri (2026)

If it felt like the AI race is turning into “who gets their model inside someone else’s ecosystem,” this is exactly that. Apple and Google have announced a multi-year partnership in which **Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology** are expected to underpin the **next generation of Apple Foundation Models**, and later a **more personalized Siri during 2026**.

For Apple, this signals a push to deliver a serious Siri upgrade faster. For Google, it’s a major win: Gemini potentially gains a huge distribution advantage across Apple devices.

## What exactly is included (and why it matters)

According to the announcement, the next generation of Apple’s “foundation” models will be built around **Gemini**, which should accelerate future Apple Intelligence capabilities — including Siri becoming more “personal” and more capable throughout 2026.

One key detail: financial terms haven’t been publicly disclosed, but the strategic intent is obvious — this reshapes the balance of power in the AI assistant market.

## What about the ChatGPT integration?

Apple already offers ChatGPT as an option for more complex prompts, but this news suggests Google will have a bigger role in the “core layer” of intelligence, while other models may remain optional add-ons.

For users, that could be a net positive: fewer “handoffs” between an assistant and external services, and more answers that feel like they actually understand context.

## Privacy: where do requests get processed?

Apple has long pushed the idea that as much processing as possible should happen on-device, and for heavier tasks it uses “Private Cloud Compute.” The announcement emphasizes that Apple Intelligence will continue to follow that approach, with privacy as a priority.

In other words: even when a more powerful model is involved, Apple aims to keep control over how processing is handled and how user data is protected.

## Why this is a big story (and why now)

This partnership highlights two broader shifts:

1) **AI is becoming a platform layer** — like search engines and browsers became before it. Being “default” creates massive advantage.  
2) Apple is willing to borrow capability from outside rather than build everything alone, to deliver the Siri leap people have been waiting for.

It also raises fresh questions: from competition dynamics with OpenAI to potential regulatory scrutiny (especially given Apple and Google’s history of major partnerships).

## Conclusion

If everything goes as planned, 2026 could be the year Siri finally gets a major upgrade — powered by Google’s Gemini technology. For users, that may mean a smarter, more useful, more natural assistant. For the AI industry, it’s another sign of power consolidating around a small number of giants.
