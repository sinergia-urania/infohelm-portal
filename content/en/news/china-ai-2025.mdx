# China in the AI race 2025: Kimi, Doubao, Qwen3 and the ban on foreign chips

If a few years ago you asked “where is China in the ChatGPT story?”, the answer would have been: **behind**. Today, the answer is much more complicated. Major players like Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance and Tencent have built their own **generative models**, domestic “ChatGPT-style” apps and a parallel AI ecosystem that is growing inside China – but increasingly affects the rest of the world as well.

At the same time, Beijing is making serious geopolitical moves:

- banning **foreign AI chips** in state-funded data centers,
- tightening controls on exports of strategic materials and technologies,
- while U.S. officials warn that China may already be **overtaking the United States** in some parts of AI.

This article is an overview of where China stands in the AI race in 2025 and why that matters to anyone following global tech – from small developers to big investors.

## Chinese models: Kimi, Qwen3, Doubao, Yuanbao and DeepSeek

Chinese AI companies did not give up after the initial shock of ChatGPT – quite the opposite. Over the last two years they have released a whole wave of models and applications:

- **Qwen3** (Alibaba) – a third-generation, more efficient model that is roughly **a quarter of the size** of the largest Western models, but very close in performance. Smaller size means **lower costs** per token and easier deployment into real products.
- **Kimi K2** (Moonshot AI) – one of the largest **open-source** models coming out of China, positioned as an answer to Western “foundation” models. The goal is to give the Chinese ecosystem a powerful base model that domestic companies can fine-tune for their own needs.
- **Doubao** (ByteDance, owner of TikTok) and **Yuanbao** (Tencent) – popular apps/aggregators where users can choose between different models (including DeepSeek), with an interface closer to a super-app experience than a classic chat window.
- **DeepSeek** – less known in the West, but in China often described as one of the technically most advanced models, especially when hosted on ByteDance’s VolcEngine cloud.

For a typical user in China, the experience is often **not “go to a single website like ChatGPT”**, but “open a super-app” (WeChat, Douyin/TikTok, Doubao…) and use AI as just one feature inside an existing ecosystem – chat, video, shopping, payments, all under one roof.

## Regulation and censorship: AI inside the walls

A huge difference compared to the West is that generative AI in China operates under:

- strict **“Interim Measures”** on generative AI,
- heavy **censorship of sensitive topics** (politics, history, social controversies),
- a requirement that models uphold “socialist values” and “social harmony”.

Models such as:

- **ERNIE** (Baidu),
- **Qwen** (Alibaba),
- **Doubao** (ByteDance),
- **Kimi** (Moonshot),

must filter their outputs so they never cross the line of what the state considers acceptable. This affects:

- **performance** – the model must “think” not only about what is true, but also what is politically allowed,
- **openness** – many APIs and open-source releases come with additional constraints,
- **reliability** – answers on sensitive topics can be selective or heavily sanitised.

In other words, China’s AI ecosystem is becoming technically stronger, but ideologically constrained – which at the same time reduces its global appeal and makes it highly optimized for the domestic market.

## AI chips: banning foreign GPUs from state data centers

On the hardware level something arguably even more important is happening: **Beijing is banning the use of foreign AI chips in state-funded data centers**. This directly hits U.S. manufacturers:

- **Nvidia**,
- **AMD**,
- **Intel**,

whose GPUs have so far been the default choice for AI training and inference.

China’s goals are clear:

- reduce dependence on U.S. technologies,
- speed up the development of **domestic AI accelerators**,
- and protect critical infrastructure from being “switched off” via sanctions or tighter export controls.

In parallel, China is:

- tightening **export controls on rare-earth elements and magnets**,
- signalling that it can push back against the West precisely in the area of raw materials and components vital for chips and electric motors.

The result is an increasingly sharp **tech–geopolitics split**: while the U.S. tries to limit China’s access to the most advanced chips, China is trying to show it can build its own – and at the same time put pressure on the West via control of key materials.

## U.S. nervousness: “They might already be ahead”

On the U.S. political scene, concern is rising that China is not just catching up but may **already be ahead** in certain AI segments:

- some members of Congress openly argue that China is in front when it comes to specific AI chips and applications,
- security services warn about the risk of Chinese AI and chips being used in military and cyber operations,
- at the same time, U.S. companies (Nvidia, Big Tech) have a strong interest in **continuing to do business in China**, even under a restricted regime.

The picture is contradictory:

- on the one hand, the U.S. is trying to **slow down** China’s progress with export controls and restrictions;
- on the other hand, global markets and investors are pouring **more and more AI money into China**, a country with huge numbers of users, cheaper manufacturing and strong state backing.

## Conclusion: a parallel AI world you shouldn’t underestimate

When Americans ask “how far has China really come in AI?”, the honest 2025 answer is:

- in terms of **raw model power** and innovation – China is no longer a laggard. It is building a **parallel AI world** with its own giants, open-source models and super-app ecosystem;
- in terms of **free speech and open data** – China is still constrained by regulatory and ideological limits that turn off many global users and developers;
- in terms of **chips and infrastructure** – Beijing is aggressively pushing for self-sufficiency, while the West is increasingly worried that Chinese AI and hardware could become global competitors rather than just customers.

For InfoHelm Tech readers the takeaway is simple: **the AI race is no longer just an “OpenAI vs Google vs xAI” story**. There is an entire Chinese block in play, with its own rules, constraints and ambitions.

The sooner we understand how that parallel ecosystem works – who the main players are, which models actually stand out and how Chinese regulation shapes them – the better we can see where global AI is really heading and what kind of world we may be living in 5–10 years from now.
