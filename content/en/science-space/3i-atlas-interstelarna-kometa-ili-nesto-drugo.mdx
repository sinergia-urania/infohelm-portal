# 3I/ATLAS – interstellar comet or something else entirely?

For the third time in history, we’ve been visited by an **object that doesn’t belong to our Solar System**.  
After ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, along comes **3I/ATLAS** – an object so strange that it quickly generated both new science and a fresh wave of conspiracy theories.

Officially, 3I/ATLAS is an “interstellar comet” discovered in July 2025 within the Hawaiian–Chilean **ATLAS** project. Its orbit is clearly hyperbolic, which means it comes from interstellar space and **will never return**.

Unofficially, social media is on fire:  
is this just a frozen chunk of ice and dust, or **a probe from another civilization**?

## How 3I/ATLAS was discovered

3I/ATLAS was first recorded on 1 July 2025 in images taken by the **Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)** telescope in Chile.  
Very quickly it became clear that:

- it comes from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius,  
- it moves at about **58 km/s** relative to the Sun,  
- it follows a **hyperbolic orbit** – so it is not gravitationally bound to the Solar System.  

Because of that orbit it received the designation **3I** (“third interstellar object”), and the suffix ATLAS from the project that first detected it.

## What is really strange about 3I/ATLAS?

Not everything weird is automatically an “alien weapon”, but 3I/ATLAS objectively has several features that set it apart from “standard” comets.

### 1. Older than the Solar System?

Analyses suggest that 3I/ATLAS likely formed in another planetary system **more than 7 billion years ago**, which makes it **older than our Sun**.  

That makes it a cosmic fossil – a capsule preserving the chemical fingerprint of a long–dead system.

### 2. Completely “skewed” chemistry – CO₂ instead of water

Comets we know in our system are usually **water ice + a bit of CO₂ and CO**.  
In 3I/ATLAS, the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)** saw something quite different.

Spectroscopic measurements show that the **coma is extremely rich in CO₂** gas:  
the **CO₂ / H₂O ≈ 8** ratio is among the highest ever measured for a comet.  

That suggests that it:

- either formed in a region of its home system where CO₂ ice condenses easily,  
- or spent billions of years exposed to much stronger radiation than our comets, so water was “burned off” faster than CO₂.

On top of that, **CO, OCS, water ice and dust** have been detected as well – but in ratios quite different from what we’re used to.

### 3. Asymmetric coma and “weird tail”

JWST and other telescopes show that:

- the coma is not symmetric around the nucleus,  
- **activity is enhanced on the Sun–facing side**,  
- at times the comet appears to have a tail that doesn’t point in the “classic” direction.  

For astrophysicists this is mostly a sign of **uneven outgassing of gas and dust** from the surface – one side of the nucleus is shedding much more material than the other.

### 4. Slight “non–gravitational” acceleration

Orbit specialists have also detected **tiny deviations from the path the comet would follow under gravity alone**.  

This has been seen in other comets too: as gas escapes from the nucleus, it pushes the body in the opposite direction – like a small rocket engine.

- **Mainstream explanation:** ordinary non–gravitational force from outgassing.  
- **Speculative reading:** some authors (like Avi Loeb) remind us that a similar effect was seen with ‘Oumuamua and ask whether such behaviour could, in principle, hide **a controlled propulsion system**.  

So far, the data does not require any exotic explanation – but it certainly keeps the imagination awake.

### 5. Changes in colour and brightness

Observations from Earth show that **the colour and brightness of 3I/ATLAS change over time** more than in a typical comet. Most likely that’s because different layers of ice (CO₂, CO, H₂O) sublimate at different distances from the Sun.

## Scientists between excitement and theories

### Official view: unusual, but still a comet

Most researchers see 3I/ATLAS as a **very exotic, but still natural comet**:

- its chemistry is extreme, but still within what models allow for other protoplanetary disks,  
- non–gravitational accelerations are small and expected for an active comet,  
- JWST and other telescopes clearly pick up gas and dust feeding its coma.  

For them, 3I/ATLAS is above all a **fantastic natural laboratory**: a chunk of ice from another system, older than our Sun.

### “Maybe it’s hollow… maybe it’s a probe?”

At the same time, there is a **minority of voices** not fully satisfied with the standard explanations.

Astrophysicist Avi Loeb, already known for suggesting that ‘Oumuamua might be artificial, argues that:

- the combination of unusual orbit,  
- non–standard chemistry,  
- and its dynamic behaviour

leaves room for a “technological” interpretation – e.g. **a hollow object, a probe, or a fragment of a larger structure**.  

For now, however, **there are no direct signs** of an artificial origin – only a list of oddities that can (so far) be explained by natural processes. Most of the scientific community remains sceptical and stresses: *extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence*.

## Where are the “real” images – and why did Congress ask NASA?

Pouring oil on the fire, **NASA did not immediately publish every image** of 3I/ATLAS, especially those taken when the object passed near Mars and orbiters had a good view.  

- A US congresswoman (Anna Paulina Luna) officially asked NASA to release the images and data at full resolution, precisely because public speculation was ramping up.  
- NASA, for its part, points out that it has already released plenty of information (orbital solutions, Hubble images, JWST results), but that **detailed data go through the usual calibration and scientific analysis** before being made public.  

The result: from the public’s perspective, a feeling that NASA is “silent”, and more room for wild stories on social media.

## What if it’s “just a comet”?

Even if 3I/ATLAS turns out to be “just” a natural comet, it is still **a huge deal**:

- we get a chance to study **a block of ice from another system**,  
- we can compare its chemistry with comets in our own system,  
- that helps us understand how similar (or different) other planetary systems may be.  

In other words, 3I/ATLAS is a test for our theories about planet formation and protoplanetary disk chemistry.

## And what if it isn’t?

If one day it turns out that one of these objects **really is artificial**, that would probably be the most important scientific discovery in human history.

For now, however:

- we have no signals,  
- we see no structures that are clearly “machine–like”,  
- there is nothing that passes strict scientific scrutiny as solid evidence of technology.

So it’s healthy to keep **two thoughts in your head at the same time**:

1. be open to the unexpected,  
2. but demand solid proof before jumping from “this is weird” to “this is an alien probe”.

## How you can follow 3I/ATLAS yourself

If you want to track where 3I/ATLAS is right now:

- use interactive tools like *NASA Eyes on the Solar System* or websites like *TheSkyLive*,  
- local astronomy forums often share ephemerides and finder charts, especially when the object is above the horizon.  

For amateurs with larger telescopes it’s a challenging, but fascinating target.

## Conclusion: the question is not just *what* 3I/ATLAS is, but *what we do* with it

3I/ATLAS forces us to combine:

- **science** (precise measurements, models),  
- **imagination** (what if we’re not alone?),  
- **critical thinking** (how far can we go without evidence).

It might be “just” a very old and oddly composed lump of ice from another system.  
It might carry the imprint of conditions in a stellar environment that died long ago.  

Either way, the best answer is: **read the papers, look at the data, and only then build theories** – not the other way around.
