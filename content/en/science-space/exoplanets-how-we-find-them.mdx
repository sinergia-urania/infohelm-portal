When we say “we discovered a new planet,” most people imagine a telescope *taking a picture* like a camera. The reality is more interesting: **we usually don’t see exoplanets directly**—we identify them by the traces they leave on their star.

It’s like being in the dark and not seeing a person, but noticing:
- a shadow crossing a lamp,
- a glass shifting on the table,
- or footsteps that reveal someone is there.

In astronomy, that “trace” is typically light and gravity.

## Method #1: Transit — the planet causes a tiny “eclipse”

This is the most famous method and the reason you often hear about a “dip in starlight.”

**How it works:**
- the planet passes in front of the star (from our viewpoint),
- the star becomes slightly dimmer,
- instruments measure the dip and draw a light curve.

**What we can learn from transits:**
- the planet’s **size** (how much light it blocks),
- its **orbital period** (how often the dip repeats),
- and, if we also know its mass from another method, we can estimate **density**—a clue to whether it’s rocky or gaseous.

**Drawback:** the geometry has to line up. If the orbit isn’t edge-on to us, we won’t see a transit.

## Method #2: Radial velocity — the star “wobbles”

A planet and its star actually orbit their shared center of mass. The star is huge so it moves only a little—but enough for us to detect.

**How we measure it:**
- we observe the star’s spectral lines,
- due to the Doppler effect, those lines shift slightly as the star moves toward/away from us.

**What we get:**
- the planet’s **minimum mass** (limited by the orbit’s tilt),
- an excellent way to confirm transit candidates.

**Advantage:** doesn’t require perfect alignment like transits, but it demands extremely precise instruments.

## Method #3: Direct imaging — rare, but spectacular

This is what people picture: “here’s the planet’s photo.”

**The problem:** a star is blindingly bright compared to its planet.  
That’s why astronomers use:
- coronagraphs (to block the star’s light),
- sophisticated image processing,
- and often target large planets far from their stars, where contrast is more favorable.

**What we can get:**
- light from the planet itself,
- sometimes even clues about its atmosphere (via spectra).

**Drawback:** it’s hard—so it’s less common.

## Method #4: Gravitational microlensing — a cosmic “zoom”

If a foreground star (with a planet) passes almost perfectly in front of a more distant background star, gravity can magnify the background star’s light. The planet adds a smaller, distinct “bump” in the brightness curve.

**What’s special about microlensing:**
- it can detect planets far from their stars,
- even “rogue” planets that don’t orbit any star.

**Drawback:** the event is one-time—once it’s over, it’s difficult to repeat the measurement.

## Method #5: Astrometry — measuring tiny shifts on the sky

This is wobble detection too, but instead of Doppler shifts (velocity), we measure the star’s **position on the sky** over time.

**Advantage:** strong for massive planets and wide orbits.  
**Drawback:** requires extreme positional precision.

## Okay, but… how do we know it isn’t a false alarm?

In science, it’s normal for an early signal to be a “candidate,” and only later become confirmed.

Common sources of false positives:
- two stars blended in the same field (a “fake” transit),
- star spots and stellar pulsations (can mimic signals),
- instrument noise.

That’s why astronomers often combine methods:
- transit + radial velocity,
- transit + timing variations (TTV),
- direct imaging + long-term monitoring.

## The next level: atmospheres and “is it habitable?”

With transits, we can sometimes measure an **atmospheric spectrum**: a small fraction of starlight passes through the planet’s atmosphere and picks up chemical fingerprints.

That’s where the big questions start:
- is there water vapor?
- what’s the composition?
- what about clouds?
- and the most sensitive question: **biosignatures** (possible signs of life)

Important note: even if we detect a molecule associated with life on Earth, it’s *not* automatic proof. Natural processes can produce similar signals, so interpretation requires extreme caution.

## Conclusion

Exoplanets are a perfect example of how science works without “magic”: we can’t always see things directly, but by measuring light and gravity with high precision, we can reconstruct entire planetary systems.

And that may be the most beautiful part: from a barely noticeable dip in brightness or a microscopic Doppler shift, we “map” worlds we may never visit—yet understand better with every new observation.
