# 3I/ATLAS – the third interstellar visitor and NASA’s big photo hunt

When 1I/ʻOumuamua passed through the Solar System in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019, astronomers realized that our neighborhood is occasionally visited by **“strangers” from other planetary systems**. We now have **a third such guest** – the interstellar comet **3I/ATLAS**, discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.

Within days of its discovery it became clear that the object **does not follow a closed ellipse**, but a hyperbolic trajectory – a classic signature of a body coming **from outside, from interstellar space**. Its chemical “fingerprint” also suggests that 3I/ATLAS probably formed in a **system older than our own**, carrying ice and dust that date back to “before the Sun”.

To make sure they wouldn’t miss this opportunity, NASA launched a true **multi-mission “photo hunt”**: the comet is being tracked simultaneously by the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, spacecraft in Mars orbit, and even rovers on the surface of the Red Planet.

## What exactly is 3I/ATLAS and where does it come from?

The designation **3I** means “third interstellar object” (after ʻOumuamua and Borisov), while “ATLAS” comes from the **Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System**, an automated telescope network that constantly searches for potentially hazardous objects. The first detections came from the Rio Hurtado observatory in Chile; follow-up observations quickly confirmed that the comet originates in **another stellar system** and will pass through ours **only once**.

The key facts in short:

- 3I/ATLAS is a **comet** – a mixture of ice, dust and rock that forms a coma and tail when heated.
- Estimates of the nucleus size are uncertain, but fall somewhere between **a few hundred meters and a few kilometers**.
- It passed closest to the Sun in **October 2025**, and will make its **closest approach to Earth in the second half of December**, at a distance of about **270 million kilometers** – so there is **no risk to our planet**.

The chemical composition looks “familiar, yet different”: the coma contains **carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, cyanide** and an unexpectedly large amount of **nickel** – a mix similar to some Solar System comets, but with nuances that point to a **different chemical history** of the stellar system it comes from.

## How do we know it is interstellar – and why is it so special?

The main evidence that 3I/ATLAS is not “our” comet is its **orbit**. Instead of an ellipse around the Sun, it follows a **strongly open hyperbola**: the comet enters at high speed, bends around the Sun’s gravity and then leaves forever. Astronomers often compare such objects to a **“cosmic slingshot”** – once they pass perihelion, they never come back.

Moreover, its incoming speed and direction do not match any known family of comets from the Oort cloud. It **comes from a completely different part of the Milky Way**, and some measurements suggest that its parent system is **several billion years older than ours**, making 3I/ATLAS potentially **the oldest comet ever observed**.

For astronomy, that’s a gold mine:

- we get a **sample of ice and dust** from a completely different planetary system,
- we can compare the **chemistry of “foreign” and “local” comets**,
- we better understand how planetary systems form and how often they eject objects into interstellar space.

## NASA’s multi-mission campaign: from Mars to Hubble and Webb

Instead of relying on a single telescope, NASA has engaged **an entire fleet of spacecraft and observatories** to follow 3I/ATLAS:

- **Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)** imaged the comet with its HiRISE camera when it passed about 30 million kilometers from Mars. In the image, the comet appears as a small fuzzy dot with a hint of a tail – but clear enough to track the coma structure.
- **MAVEN**, **PUNCH**, **STEREO** and other heliophysics missions observed the comet at different wavelengths, measuring how the solar wind “whips” its tail.
- **Hubble** captured a detailed view of the coma – a bluish “cocoon” of dust and gas around the nucleus, with bright streaks of background stars.
- **James Webb** observed the comet in the infrared, helping to disentangle different types of ices and gases in the coma.

This strategy – **“many eyes, one opportunity”** – allows scientists to connect:

- the chemistry of the coma and tail,
- the interaction with the solar wind,
- and the precise orbital dynamics,

into a coherent story of **how a comet from a completely different stellar system behaves**.

## Not a UFO: why scientists keep saying “this is a comet”

As with ʻOumuamua, the internet quickly exploded with theories that 3I/ATLAS might be an **artificial object** or even a spacecraft. This time NASA addressed the rumors **right away** during its press briefings: instruments see no signs of any “technosignatures” – no radio signals, no regular pulses, no strange maneuvers or anything that would suggest an artificial origin.

Instead, everything observed is consistent with:

- normal sublimation of ices as the comet is heated,
- the formation of a coma and tail,
- and an orbit that exactly matches what we’d expect from gravity acting on a natural object.

In other words, **it behaves exactly as a comet should** – the only unusual thing is that this one comes from a distant, foreign stellar neighborhood.

## Can 3I/ATLAS be seen from Earth?

Unlike some spectacular comets of the past, 3I/ATLAS **will not become a naked-eye object**. Even at peak brightness it is expected to remain faint, but:

- it will be within reach of **amateur astronomers with small telescopes**,
- the best observing window will be **late 2025 and early 2026**, as it moves away from the Sun but remains sufficiently active.

For professionals and space missions, however, this is a true **cosmic hunting season** – the last chance to extract as much data as possible before the comet disappears into interstellar darkness for good.

## Conclusion

3I/ATLAS is far more than just another comet:

- it is the **third confirmed interstellar visitor**,  
- probably **older than our Solar System**,  
- and the first that NASA has been able to monitor systematically with an entire fleet of spacecraft and telescopes.

For science, it is **a direct sample of another planetary system**, without sending a probe to another star. For us “down on Earth”, it is a reminder that the Solar System is not isolated, but constantly exchanging comets, asteroids and cosmic dust with the rest of the galaxy.
