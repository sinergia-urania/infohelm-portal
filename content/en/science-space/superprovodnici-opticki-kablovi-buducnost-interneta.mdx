# Superconductors and optical fibers – from copper wires to the internet of the future

Most of us still instinctively imagine **Wi-Fi**, 4G/5G or a copper cable going into the router when we hear the word “internet”.  
In reality, the majority of global traffic travels through **thousands of kilometers of optical fibers** – glass threads thinner than a hair, buried underground or lying on the ocean floor.

At the same time, physicists in laboratories are developing **superconductors** – materials that, at low temperatures, conduct electricity with **zero electrical resistance**. That means: no losses, no heating, no energy wasted as heat in the cables.

When you connect these two worlds – **light in fibers** and **current without resistance** – you get one of the most interesting visions of future technology:

- faster and more stable internet,  
- quantum communication networks,  
- power systems with minimal losses,  
- completely new types of computers.

In this article we’ll walk through the basics: what superconductors are, how optical fibers work and why physicists are building **exotic hybrids** that combine both.

## 1. What are superconductors (and why everyone is chasing “room temperature”)

In ordinary metals (copper, aluminium) electrons constantly collide with the crystal lattice of atoms → energy turns into heat → wires warm up and part of the energy is lost.

A **superconductor** is a special material which, below a certain critical temperature:

- has **exactly zero electrical resistance**,  
- can carry huge currents without heating up,  
- expels magnetic fields from its interior (the Meissner effect).

This enables things like:

- **MRI magnets** in hospitals,  
- **levitating trains** (maglev),  
- superconducting magnets for particle accelerators (CERN).

But today physics aims much higher:  
we’re looking for **superconductors that work at ever higher temperatures**, ideally close to room temperature. That would mean:

- near-lossless cables in power grids,  
- superconducting components in servers and data centers,  
- quantum processors with much simpler cooling.

For now, most “high-temperature” superconductors still work **far below zero** (in kelvins), with liquid nitrogen or helium for cooling.  
But the pace of research and the variety of materials (cuprates, iron-based, nickelates, hydrides under huge pressure…) show that this is one of the hottest fields in modern physics.

## 2. Optical fibers – how light carries the internet

Unlike copper cables where electricity flows, in an optical fiber **light** travels – laser pulses bouncing inside the fiber core and covering thousands of kilometers with very low losses.

The magic comes from:

- an **ultra-pure glass core** with a precisely tuned refractive index,  
- **total internal reflection** – light “walks” through the fiber without leaking out,  
- the ability to send **multiple wavelengths** (different “colors” of light) at the same time – called **WDM, wavelength-division multiplexing**.

The result:

- today the capacity of a single fiber is measured in **terabits per second**,  
- under the oceans lie cables that carry almost all of our messages, video calls, gaming packets and AI requests.

And again, researchers don’t stop here – they’re working on **exotic versions of optical fibers**:

- **hollow-core fibers**, where light travels through air instead of glass,  
- fibers with **multiple cores**, where one physical fiber carries many independent channels,  
- structures using **photonic crystals** and special core shapes to reduce latency and losses even further.

## 3. Where superconductors and optical fibers meet

At first glance, one world is “current in solid matter”, the other is “light in glass”.  
In practice, modern infrastructure increasingly needs **their combination**.

### 3.1. Superconducting single-photon detectors

In quantum communication and quantum internet projects, the key is to detect **single photons** that carry quantum information (quantum bits – qubits).

This is where **superconducting SNSPD detectors** (superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors) come in:

- they are built from ultra-thin superconducting wires at cryogenic temperatures,  
- they can “feel” the arrival of a single photon from an optical fiber,  
- their error rate is extremely low.

Without such detectors, a practical **quantum internet** would be almost impossible.

### 3.2. Superconducting filters and processors for telecom

Superconductors are also used in:

- **very selective RF filters** in telecom equipment,  
- experimental **superconducting logic circuits** (e.g. RSFQ technology) for ultra-fast digital systems.

Imagine a future data center where:

- light comes through optical fibers directly to the chip,  
- inside the chip signals are processed by superconducting logic with almost zero dissipation.

That would be a huge revolution for AI, cloud computing and everything currently constrained by energy and cooling in big server farms.

## 4. Quantum internet: when photons in fibers carry quantum keys

Another exotic direction is the **quantum internet** – a network that uses quantum mechanics for:

- **quantum key distribution (QKD)** – cryptographic keys exchanged using quantum states of photons,  
- communication that is **impossible to eavesdrop on** without being detected.

Here optical fibers + superconducting detectors + quantum repeaters form the team:

- optical fibers carry quantum photons across and between cities,  
- superconducting detectors catch those photons at the receiving end,  
- quantum repeaters (still under development) should one day enable links over hundreds or thousands of kilometers without losing quantum information.

For now these are mostly **experimental networks** – pilot links between universities, banks and government institutions.  
But the principle is clear: light in optics + superconducting components at key points.

## 5. What all this means in practice

For the average user all this sounds like sci-fi, but the consequences will be very down-to-earth:

1. **Faster and more reliable internet “behind the scenes”**  
   - advanced optical fibers reduce latency and losses in backbone networks,  
   - better telecom components (including superconducting ones) increase capacity without exploding energy use.

2. **Possible new types of data centers**  
   - if superconducting technologies become more practical, data centers could use far less power per operation,  
   - today a huge part of AI power consumption goes into cooling – superconductors attack that problem directly.

3. **Communication security**  
   - quantum internet doesn’t mean “faster” internet, but **more secure against eavesdropping**,  
   - in a world that relies more and more on digital infrastructure, this could become a critical technology.

4. **Power grids**  
   - superconducting cables are already being tested in some cities as part of power networks,  
   - in the future they could carry huge amounts of electricity across long distances with almost no losses.

## 6. A good way to leave “space” without leaving science

Up to now, our “science & space” topics often meant:

- exoplanets,  
- black holes,  
- space missions and telescopes.

This story takes a different angle:

- we’re still firmly in **fundamental physics** (quantum mechanics, cryogenics, photonics),  
- but the topic is very **earthly** – cables, internet, electricity, data centers.

It’s a nice bridge to future articles on:

- quantum sensors,  
- MRI and medical physics,  
- new materials,  
- bio-physics and AI in drug discovery.

## Conclusion

Superconductors and optical fibers look like two separate worlds – one deals with **current flowing without resistance**, the other with **light racing through glass**.

In reality they’re becoming **pillars of the future internet and energy infrastructure**:

- superconductors as a path to systems with minimal losses and powerful magnetic and logic components,  
- optical fibers as the bloodstream of global communication, getting faster and more sophisticated every year,  
- their combination in the form of quantum networks, superconducting detectors and exotic photonic structures.

For us as users, the key point is that this is not just “lab playtime” –  
but technology that will, over the next decades, decide:

- how fast we communicate,  
- how much energy our digital world consumes,  
- and how safely our information is stored in the age of ubiquitous AI.
