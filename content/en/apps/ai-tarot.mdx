> **TL;DR**  
> Una Astro-Tarot AI blends the Rider–Waite deck, astrological transits and modern AI to give contextual, personal readings instead of random messages.

## What is Una Astro-Tarot AI?

Una Astro-Tarot AI combines modern AI technology with archetypal tarot and astrological symbolism to provide **personalised, thoughtful and practical** interpretations.

The AI **does not produce random text** – it analyses:

- your question  
- the exact spread of the cards  
- current astrological transits (with a monthly focus)

so that the reading feels like a focused consultation, not a generic horoscope.

## How does the astro–tarot reading work?

All spreads in the app (except **“Card of the Day”** and **“Yes/No”**, which are more intuitive by nature) interpret the cards through a **multi-layer symbolic system** and try to recognise an inner logic related to your question.

**In practice:**

- you can choose from a list of frequently asked questions (love, career, self-growth, spirituality, etc.)  
- you can always type **your own custom question**  
- the AI then reads the spread **in relation to that specific question**  
- monthly transits provide extra timing context: when it’s better to act, change or wait.

This leads to readings that are **personal, time-sensitive and relevant**.

## Access & plans

Access is structured into three main plans, plus an AdReward option:

- **Free** – basic access with a limited number of spreads and features.  
- **Premium** – unlocks additional spread types and deeper insights.  
- **Pro** – full access to all tools, analysis and personalisation (including advanced astro–tarot layouts).

In addition to subscriptions, there is an **AdReward** option – by watching ads you can unlock certain features as an **alternative to paying**.

## A note on what the app does (and doesn’t) do

The app **does not claim to predict the future in a deterministic way**.  
Instead, it:

- highlights potential directions a situation may take  
- helps you notice inner patterns and dynamics  
- uses archetypal card language and astrological symbolism to illuminate what you can **consciously work on**.

The goal of Una Astro-Tarot AI is not to decide for you, but to be a **guide and mirror** so you can make clearer decisions yourself.
