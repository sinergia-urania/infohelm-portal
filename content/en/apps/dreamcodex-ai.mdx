> **TL;DR**  
> DreamCodex AI combines a private dream journal with AI models tuned for scientific (Jung/Freud/Szondi) and traditional symbolic methods, so you can explore your dreams in a grounded yet deeply intuitive way.

## What is DreamCodex AI?

**DreamCodex AI** is your companion for dream interpretation, reflection and conscious sleep practice.

It blends two complementary approaches:

- **Scientific method (Jung / Freud / Szondi):** symbolic analysis, archetypes, affect and context.  
- **Traditional method:** folk and esoteric symbolics collected across centuries.

You can use them **separately** or **combined** for a richer synthesis, depending on what fits your style of inner work.

## How it works

1. **Enter your dream** — type it out or use **speech-to-text** if you’re still half-asleep.  
2. Choose the **method**: Scientific / Traditional, or combine both.  
3. Your current **plan** (Free / Premium / Pro) automatically applies the right AI model and features.  
4. You receive a clear, human-readable interpretation with:
   - symbolic breakdown of the dream,
   - links to waking-life context,
   - practical insights and reflection prompts.

The idea is not “fortune-telling”, but **guided self-inquiry**.

## Philosophy

We honour the mystery of dreams while offering grounded frames from psychology and tradition.

DreamCodex AI is designed to be:

- **supportive** — it suggests, it doesn’t dictate,  
- **non-dogmatic** — no rigid “if you dream X, Y will happen”,  
- **insight-oriented** — focused on what you can actually **work with** in your waking life.

The goal is not to replace therapists, spiritual teachers or your own intuition, but to act as a **mirror** and **structuring tool** for inner work.

---

## Plans, quota & bank 🏦🪙

Each plan includes a monthly number of AI interpretations:

- **Free – 10** per month  
- **Premium – 30** per month  
- **Pro – 50** per month  

- Free resets to **10** every month and **doesn’t accumulate**.  
- Premium and Pro can carry over unused balance up to a **bank cap**:
  - Premium: **90**  
  - Pro: **150**

One credit is used when the AI answer appears on the **Result** screen.

This system is aligned with the broader InfoHelm ecosystem, so that account, quota and “coin bank” logic feels familiar if you also use **Una Astro-Tarot AI** or future InfoHelm apps.
