# Tomb Raider guide: where to start, what to play, and in what order

If there’s one franchise you can recommend even to someone who “isn’t a gamer” and still get them hooked, it’s **Tomb Raider**. It has everything: exploration, atmospheric locations, puzzles, traps, big set-piece moments, and that “one more tomb and I’m done” effect.

But… Tomb Raider has multiple eras and styles, so the real question is **where to start**.

## Quick pick: which Tomb Raider is for you?

**If you want a modern entry point, strong pacing, and smooth gameplay:**  
👉 *Tomb Raider (2013)*, then continue through the modern trilogy.

**If you love old-school adventure with heavier puzzle focus (“real tombs”):**  
👉 The classic era (originals or remasters—depending on what you prefer).

**If you want something in-between (classic Lara feel with a modern flow):**  
👉 The *Legend / Anniversary / Underworld* era is a great middle ground.

## Two major eras (and why they feel like different games)

### 1) Classic era: puzzles + exploration first
The classics focus on:
- labyrinth-like spaces, switches, secret passages
- careful exploration and mentally mapping environments
- that “aha!” moment when the room’s logic clicks

If you’re into *Indiana Jones* vibes and puzzle-driven design, this is your lane.

### 2) Modern era: more narrative, more action, modern pacing
Modern Tomb Raider (starting in 2013) brings:
- stronger narrative pacing
- more cinematic flow
- tombs and exploration, but with more modern guidance

If you like story-forward adventure with exploration on the side, it’s a perfect fit.

## Recommended play order (no overthinking)

### Path A: The easiest entry (best for beginners)
1) *Tomb Raider (2013)*  
2) *Rise of the Tomb Raider*  
3) *Shadow of the Tomb Raider*

Why it works: it hooks fast, feels modern, and still delivers tombs and exploration.

### Path B: “I want the roots—real tombs”
1) *Tomb Raider I–III* (classics / remasters)  
2) If you’re into it: *Tomb Raider IV–VI* (darker tone, different design style)

Why it works: you get what made the series legendary—puzzles and exploration as the core.

### Path C: “Classic Lara, but with a modern feel”
1) *Legend*  
2) *Anniversary*  
3) *Underworld*

Why it works: a great balance of adventure pacing and classic Tomb Raider flavor.

## Quick tips that save you frustration

- **If you’re new:** start on normal (or even easier). The classics especially reward patience.
- **Don’t be afraid to take a break:** puzzle design often clicks after 5 minutes away.
- **Explore side areas:** tombs and hidden rooms are the soul of the franchise.
- **Headphones help:** traps, ambience, and music hit harder and improve immersion.

## So… what’s the “best” Tomb Raider?

It depends on what you want:
- modern, fast entry point: **(2013)**
- a strong balance of story and exploration: **Rise**
- more tomb/puzzle emphasis in the modern style: **Shadow**
- pure old-school puzzle adventure: **the classics**

The best part: it’s hard to go truly wrong—just pick the path that matches your taste.

## Conclusion

Tomb Raider is evergreen because it combines two rare things: **adventure that pulls you forward** and **mysteries that make you think**. If you want the safest, simplest start, begin with *Tomb Raider (2013)*. If you want “real tombs,” go classic.
