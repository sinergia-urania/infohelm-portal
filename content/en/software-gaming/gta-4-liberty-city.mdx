# GTA IV – why its characters and story still feel unbeatable

Grand Theft Auto IV launched back in 2008 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and later PC. Yet even today – in the era of ultra–realistic graphics and next-gen consoles – this GTA entry remains a **favourite** for a huge number of players.  
Not because of visuals, but because of its **characters, story and the way Liberty City feels alive**.

For many young gamers who discover it years later, GTA IV doesn’t feel like “just an old game”, but like a **crime movie you can actually play** – with choices, consequences and a heavy atmosphere that stays with you long after you quit to desktop.

## Liberty City: a city that feels alive – even in 2025

GTA IV takes us to **Liberty City**, Rockstar’s take on New York. Instead of focusing purely on over-the-top sandbox chaos, the game puts a strong emphasis on **atmosphere**:

- narrow, dirty streets filled with graffiti, billboards and clutter  
- pedestrians constantly talking, arguing, shouting and commenting on what’s happening  
- grey skies, rain and fog that make the city feel heavy and grounded  

Compared to the sunny, colourful Los Santos of GTA V, Liberty City in GTA IV is deliberately more **grim, grounded and mature**. That’s exactly why many players love it – GTA IV feels more like a **crime drama** than a typical open-world playground.

Driving through Broker, Bohan or Algonquin, you get the sense of a real metropolis where people are barely getting by, not just a giant amusement park for stunts and explosions.

## Niko Bellic and the crew: characters you actually remember

The main protagonist, **Niko Bellic**, is an immigrant from Eastern Europe who comes to America to leave his past behind and search for a second chance. Instead of a typical “cool gangster”, we get a character who is:

- tired of war, violence and betrayal  
- haunted by guilt and trauma from his past  
- torn between loyalty to friends and the desire to finally break the cycle of crime  

Around him is a cast of side characters that are almost impossible to forget:

- **Roman** – Niko’s cousin, a hopeless optimist, gambler and taxi business owner dreaming of the “American Dream”  
- **Brucie** – an over-the-top, steroid-obsessed adrenaline junkie in love with his own reflection  
- **Packie** – part of an Irish crime family, both tough and tragically human at the same time  
- **Dimitri**, **Little Jacob**, **Michelle** and many more…  

Each one has a **distinct voice, personality and humour**, so dialogues feel natural and memorable even today. Niko is not a “perfect hero” – he’s broken, conflicted and tired, which makes his journey hit much harder.

## How it feels from a young gamer’s perspective 🎮

While older players often praise GTA IV for its writing and atmosphere, something interesting is happening with younger gamers who discover it through old consoles, PC ports or digital sales.

For many of them, GTA IV stands out because:

- **“It has the best story.”** The game feels like a long interactive movie, not just a checklist of missions.  
- **“Characters actually matter.”** Niko, Roman, Brucie and others are funny, emotional and flawed, not just background NPCs.  
- **“Liberty City feels real.”** The city isn’t just a pretty map – it has mood and personality.  

From their point of view, GTA IV isn’t just “that older GTA before V” – it becomes **the GTA that hits the hardest emotionally**.

## Why GTA IV still plays better than many newer games

Even though GTA V is newer and technically more advanced, a lot of players keep returning to GTA IV. Some of the main reasons:

- **Physics and Euphoria engine** – characters and vehicles have weight, collisions and falls feel raw and physical  
- **Darker tone** – the game is more serious, with moral choices and consequences  
- **Unforgettable missions** – missions like “Three Leaf Clover” feel like set pieces from a high–budget movie  
- **Music and radio** – the soundtrack captures the feel of the late 2000s, from rock to Eastern European tracks  

Because of all this, GTA IV is often recommended in 2025 as a game you **still absolutely should play** if you care about strong stories and characters – even if the graphics no longer lead the pack.

## Conclusion

GTA IV is much more than “just another GTA title”. It’s a game that brings together:

- a serious, emotional story  
- unforgettable characters  
- a heavy, believable city  
- and the feeling of playing through a full crime drama, not just chasing high scores  

For both older fans who played it at launch and younger gamers discovering it today, GTA IV often becomes a **personal favourite** in the series.

If you love open worlds, crime stories and flawed, human characters, there’s a good chance GTA IV will stay in your top list for years to come.  
Maybe it’s time to log back into Liberty City, call someone to go bowling and take one more long drive across the bridges – this time with fresh eyes, and a bit more appreciation for what this 2008 classic still does better than many modern games. 🎮🖤
