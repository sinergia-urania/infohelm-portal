# DePIN 2025: how crypto builds real networks for internet, energy and data

If the first crypto waves were about **digital money** (Bitcoin) and **smart contracts** (Ethereum), the new one goes a step further: crypto is entering the **physical world**. That’s where **DePIN – Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks** comes in.

The idea is simple: instead of one company building networks for **internet, sensors, EV chargers, storage or AI compute** and taking all the profit, **users themselves build the network** and are rewarded with tokens.

In this article we look at what DePIN is, how it works in practice and what it means for a regular investor who wonders: “Is this real value or just another hype cycle?”.

## What is DePIN and why is everyone suddenly talking about it?

DePIN is an umbrella term for projects that use **blockchain and tokens** to incentivize people to:

- deploy **routers and wireless hotspots**,
- share **spare storage** and internet bandwidth,
- plug in **GPUs and specialized machines** for AI and rendering,
- install **sensors, cameras and IoT devices**,
- or even create networks for **energy and EV charging**.

In return, these devices earn tokens when they provide a real service: route data, store files, run AI jobs, measure air quality, power a car, and so on. The more useful the network is, the more valuable the token should become – at least in theory.

In other words, DePIN tries to replace the model:

> “A centralized company buys all the hardware and sells you a service”

with:

> “The community buys the hardware, while the blockchain keeps score of who contributes what and splits the rewards”.

### Where is DePIN already used?

We already see projects trying to cover different verticals:

- **Wireless and IoT networks** – users install devices that extend coverage and collect sensor data.
- **Data storage** – instead of one data center, files are distributed globally, and nodes are paid to keep them online.
- **AI and compute** – GPU owners rent out processing power for AI training or 3D rendering and get paid in tokens.
- **Energy and EV charging** – early pilots where small producers, solar farms or charging stations use DePIN as a settlement and tokenization layer.

Most networks are still in the early stage, but the concept is clear: **the blockchain is the public ledger of contributions and payments**, and tokens are the glue that aligns incentives.

## How DePIN works in practice: three basic models

To make things more concrete, let’s group DePIN projects into three patterns you’ll most often see in the wild.

### 1. “I buy a box, plug it in and start earning tokens”

This is the most visible model: the project sells or licenses a **special device** (gateway, router, sensor, ASIC, mini server…). You:

1. buy it,
2. connect it to power and internet,
3. link it to your wallet / app,
4. and from that point the network rewards you with tokens for providing service.

Pros: easy to understand, “plug-and-earn” experience.  
Cons: it can quickly turn into an **expensive lottery** if:

- nobody actually uses the network (no real traffic),
- the token has weak demand,
- or the market ends up flooded with devices so rewards per node collapse.

### 2. Software DePIN: using your existing hardware

The second model doesn’t require special hardware. You install:

- an app to share excess bandwidth,
- a storage client,
- a DePIN node that uses your disk, CPU or GPU,

and you’re in.

Pros: **lower entry cost**, you can experiment with the hardware you already own.  
Cons: more competition, often smaller earnings per device and more **technical friction** (ports, configs, maintenance).

### 3. DePIN as infrastructure for AI and Web3 apps

The third wave aims to become **backend infrastructure for other projects**:

- AI startups can buy cheaper compute (GPU-as-a-service via DePIN),
- Web3 apps can rely on DePIN for storage, video streaming or CDN,
- cities and companies can integrate DePIN sensors and analytics instead of building their own infrastructure.

This model is the most interesting for long-term investors, because real value appears only when there is **stable demand from businesses**, not just speculative token trading.

## Pros and risks of DePIN projects for investors

Like every crypto trend, DePIN mixes very real potential with very real risks.

### What’s potentially good?

1. **Real demand, not just narrative**  
   If the network solves an actual problem (cheaper internet, cheaper storage, more accessible AI compute), demand for its service doesn’t rely only on the crypto bull cycle.

2. **Passive income for contributors**  
   If you join early and the network succeeds, the device you bought can earn tokens for years – like a tiny “crypto rental property”.

3. **Portfolio diversification**  
   DePIN tokens and “earn” models can be a separate bucket in a crypto portfolio, different from classic L1/L2 coins, memecoins or NFTs.

### Where are the traps?

1. **Hardware ≠ guaranteed ROI**  
   Buying a device is often marketed as an “investment”, but the real **return on investment** depends on tons of variables: token price, number of nodes, real traffic, changes in tokenomics…

2. **Centralized backend to a decentralized story**  
   Many DePIN projects are essentially **private companies with a token**, not fully decentralized networks. The company can change rules, reward distribution or even exit the scene.

3. **Regulatory grey zone**  
   If a network carries traffic, stores data or uses cameras and sensors, you immediately hit questions of privacy, licenses and local regulation – especially in the EU and US.

4. **Tokenomics that eats its own users**  
   Some networks shower early participants with tokens, but later **inflation crushes the price**, and rewards per device become negligible.

## How to approach DePIN as a “regular” crypto user?

Instead of jumping into the first YouTube pitch that promises “this box prints $1,000 a month”, a more grounded approach is:

1. **Start from the service, not the token**  
   What does the network ACTUALLY do? Who buys that service? Would you, as a business, ever pay for it?

2. **Read tokenomics as a business model**  
   How are rewards split? Who gets the initial supply – team, VCs, community? Is there a lock-up? Does the network earn from real fees or live off speculation?

3. **Test with small capital / a single device**  
   If it still looks interesting, start with a minimal stake – one device or a small allocation – and watch **support quality, software polish and community health**.

4. **Diversify inside the trend itself**  
   Instead of going all-in on one project, you can spread the risk between several networks (storage, compute, IoT) or combine DePIN exposure with classic “blue-chip” crypto.

## Conclusion

DePIN might be the first crypto trend that seriously tries to **bridge blockchain and physical infrastructure** – internet, energy, data and AI compute. If it works, it could reshape:

- how we build wireless networks,
- how we store and process information,
- and how ordinary people participate in infrastructure that used to be reserved for telecom and IT giants.

But because it touches the “real world”, DePIN also inherits all its complications: regulation, hardware costs, uncertain ROI and the risk of badly designed tokenomics.

For now, the most sensible way to treat DePIN is as a **high-risk but compelling experimental part of a portfolio** – a space worth following, learning about and testing in small doses, rather than blindly chasing the next “magic box that prints money”.
