If you’ve been in crypto for more than a few months, you’ve probably heard the line: **“Not your keys, not your coins.”**  
It sounds like a meme—but it’s actually the core of the whole game.

The good news: you don’t need to be paranoid or an “IT wizard” to stay safe. You just need to cover the 80% of actions that prevent 99% of stupid losses.

## The first rule: whoever holds the keys holds the money

In crypto, there is no “reset my password” for a private key. There are only three real scenarios:

### 1) Custodial (the exchange holds the keys)
Example: you keep everything on an exchange.  
**Pros:** simple—“login + 2FA” and you’re done.  
**Cons:** risk of hacks, account freezes, operational failures, regulatory issues, and the classic: “not our fault, but your funds are gone.”

**Practical rule:** an exchange is fine for *trading* and a smaller “operating” balance—but not for long-term savings.

### 2) Hot wallet (you hold the keys, but the device is online)
Example: a wallet app on your phone or a browser extension.  
**Pros:** fast access to DeFi, NFTs, swaps.  
**Cons:** malware, phishing, fake links, “approve” traps, a compromised device.

**Practical rule:** a hot wallet is like cash in your pocket. Keep what you need, not your life savings.

### 3) Cold wallet (hardware wallet)
Example: a device that signs transactions offline.  
**Pros:** best protection from malware/phishing (the private key never leaves the device).  
**Cons:** you must get organized about your seed phrase and backups.

**Practical rule:** a cold wallet is a safe. That’s where the majority should live.

## 10-step checklist: security that actually works

This is the part worth saving (or printing).

### 1) Never photograph your seed phrase or store it on your phone
- Not in Notes
- Not in Google Drive
- Not in an email draft
- Not in screenshots

Your seed is the **key to the safe**. If someone gets it, they can take everything—no appeals.

### 2) Back up your seed in two separate places
At minimum:
- 1 copy with you (secure location)
- 1 copy in a second location (another home, a safe deposit box, a trusted person)

The point: fire/flood/burglary should not be “game over.”

### 3) Always use 2FA—and use an app, not SMS
SMS is easy to attack (SIM swap).  
Better: an authenticator app + backup codes stored offline.

### 4) Use a “clean” device or at least a clean browser profile for crypto
Ideally:
- a separate browser profile just for crypto
- no random extensions
- no pirated software
- keep your OS updated

If your computer is a “junk drawer,” at least keep crypto work in a more sterile environment.

### 5) The most common attack is phishing, not hacking
An attacker doesn’t need to “hack your wallet.” They just need to get you to:
- click a fake link
- connect your wallet
- sign an “approve” that grants token access

**Habit that saves you:** type URLs manually or use bookmarks you created yourself.

### 6) Double-check addresses and send a test transaction
For larger amounts:
- send a small test first
- then send the rest

Yes, it’s annoying. It’s still less annoying than “I sent it to the wrong network.”

### 7) Don’t use one wallet for everything
Separate:
- a “DeFi / experiments” wallet
- a “savings / cold storage” wallet

If your DeFi wallet gets compromised, at least you don’t lose everything.

### 8) Watch your approvals (permissions)
Once you approve a token, a smart contract may be able to spend it.  
Periodically:
- review approvals
- revoke permissions you no longer need

This is a “silent leak” that drains people without them understanding what happened.

### 9) Have a plan for what happens if something happens to you
Minimum:
- where the seed is stored
- how to use it
- who you trust
- clear instructions (sealed envelope, notary, safe, etc.)

Crypto without an inheritance plan can become permanently lost wealth.

### 10) If it feels “too good to be true”—it is
“Airdrop gift,” DM “support,” “verify your wallet,” “urgent action required”…  
These are almost always scams.

**One rule:** real support will never ask for your seed. Ever.

## Conclusion

Crypto security isn’t an obsession—it’s a few healthy habits. If you follow these 10 steps, you massively reduce the chance of losing funds in the dumbest possible way.
