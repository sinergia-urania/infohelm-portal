# 2025 – the year of real-world asset tokenization: bonds, real estate and treasuries on-chain

The crypto world is used to cycles – DeFi, NFTs, memecoins, L2s… But 2024/2025 has brought a trend that looks far less flashy and potentially much deeper: **tokenization of real-world assets (RWA)**. Instead of profile pics and pixelated apes, we’re slowly seeing **government bonds, real estate, money-market funds and receivables** move onto blockchains.

By late 2025, the market value of tokenized real-world assets is estimated at around **30 billion dollars**, after a multi-year surge from a very low base. The majority is made up of tokenized government bonds and T-bill funds, but more and more projects are targeting **real estate, commercial loans and other traditional instruments**.

The question is no longer whether RWAs will exist, but **who will control that infrastructure, under which rules – and what it means for retail investors**.

## What are RWAs and why do they matter?

In simple terms, a **real-world asset (RWA) token** is a digital token on a blockchain that is backed by some off-chain asset:

- government bonds and treasury bills,
- money-market funds,
- real estate and development projects,
- business loans and receivables,
- even art pieces or collectibles.

The core idea is to **slice traditional assets into smaller, liquid digital units** that can:

- move 24/7,
- be used as collateral in DeFi protocols,
- be traded globally with fewer intermediaries,
- be integrated into smart contracts (e.g. coupon or rental payments via code).

For a regular investor, this *in theory* means:

- **lower minimums** – instead of 100,000 € in a fund, you buy a small set of tokens;
- **easier access** to instruments usually reserved for large institutions and private banks;
- **potentially lower fees** thanks to fewer middlemen.

Of course, that’s the marketing version. In practice, tokenization also introduces entirely new layers of risk – which we’ll get to shortly.

## Franklin Templeton and Benji: when a money-market fund becomes a token

One of the early RWA pioneers is **Franklin Templeton**, a traditional asset manager that launched the **Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund** back in 2021 – a money-market fund whose ownership is recorded on blockchain.

- Each share of the fund is represented by a **BENJI token** –  
  **1 BENJI = 1 fund share**.
- The fund invests in short-term **U.S. government securities**, cash and repos.
- Investors get the familiar world of money-market funds combined with **crypto-style UX** – digital wallets, on-chain transfers, integrations into DeFi/cex infrastructure.

By the end of 2025:

- Benji has expanded to **multiple networks**, including more institutional chains like Canton Network, making it easier to plug into banks and clearing houses.
- Franklin Templeton has launched **tokenized versions of the fund across the U.S., Luxembourg, Singapore and Hong Kong**, signalling that this is not a gimmick but a **strategic direction**.

In essence, **a money-market fund that once lived only in traditional custody systems now has a “digital twin” on blockchain**. That paves the way for the same model to be applied to:

- pension funds,
- ETFs,
- loan portfolios,
- even private equity vehicles.

## China, real estate and RWAs: from Seazen to regulatory brakes

RWAs are not just an American game. One of the more interesting cases comes from China’s **real-estate sector**, which has been struggling with massive debt and slow growth.

Developer **Seazen Group** announced that it would set up an institute in Hong Kong focused on **tokenizing real-world assets**, with emphasis on:

- tokenizing revenue from its malls and property projects,
- issuing digital tokens linked to Wuyue Plaza properties,
- exploring how tokens could unlock fresh liquidity in a heavily indebted sector.

A few months later, a cold shower: China’s securities regulator (CSRC) **informally urged brokers to pause RWA businesses in Hong Kong** until the risks and standards are better defined. The message is clear:

- **Beijing wants tight control over how and where Chinese assets are tokenized**,  
- Hong Kong wants to position itself as an **RWA and virtual asset hub**,  
- the difference in risk appetite and speed is already visible.

For investors, that is a reminder that RWAs are not just a technology story, but also **a geopolitical and regulatory chess match**: who is allowed to tokenize what, on which network, and under whose supervision.

## How big is the RWA market, really?

Estimates of market size differ depending on methodology:

- more conservative counts put **non-stablecoin RWAs** at roughly **20–30 billion dollars** in 2025;
- broader definitions (including parts of the stablecoin universe) push the number higher, but stablecoins still make up **well over 90% of tokenized assets**;
- major consulting and research firms project **hundreds of billions to several trillions of dollars** in tokenized assets by 2030.

In plain language: **RWAs are still a small fraction of global capital markets**, but the growth curve is interestingly different from classic crypto:

- this is not about a memecoin going 100x then crashing in two weeks,
- it’s about parts of **bonds, funds and real estate** getting a second life on blockchain rails.

## What does this mean for retail investors?

If you’re a small or medium-sized investor, RWAs potentially bring three major changes:

### 1. Access to previously “locked” instruments

Tokenization makes it possible to:

- buy **fractions** of a fund or bond portfolio with a far smaller ticket size;
- tap into structures that used to be off-limits (PE/VC funds, commercial real estate deals);
- use those same tokens as collateral in DeFi apps (with all the caveats that implies).

### 2. More flexible liquidity

Instead of waiting for:

- T+2 or T+3 settlement,
- the opening hours of an exchange or broker,

an RWA token can *in theory* enable **24/7 transfers and trading**, regardless of geography. In practice, there are still constraints (regulation, KYC, whitelisted addresses), but the direction of travel is clear.

### 3. A new layer of risk – what do you *actually* own?

The biggest problem isn’t technological, but **legal and structural**:

- does the token represent **direct ownership** of the asset (e.g. a share in a fund or a slice of a building),
- or do you merely hold a **claim** on a company that promises to hold the asset and honour the token?

The global securities regulator **IOSCO** has explicitly warned that investors may **not understand what they legally own** – an actual interest in the asset or just a digital wrapper sitting on top of it. On top of that, you get:

- third-party risks (issuers, custodians, platforms),
- technical risks (smart-contract bugs, hacks),
- regulatory risks (rule changes, bans, “pauses” like those seen in Hong Kong).

## RWAs and DeFi: bridge or Trojan horse?

For DeFi protocols, RWAs are both an opportunity and a potential Trojan horse:

- an opportunity, because they can import **“real yield” from traditional finance** (coupons, interest, rent) into on-chain products;
- a threat, because they introduce complex legal structures, centralized entities and regulatory risk into an ecosystem originally built as a reaction to over-centralization.

We already see protocols offering:

- loans collateralized by tokenized bonds,
- vaults combining stablecoins and RWA tokens,
- products promising “real yield” sourced from government treasuries.

For users, this can look very attractive – finally, yields backed by something more tangible than pure speculation. But it also means DeFi is importing **all the cracks and weaknesses of TradFi**: from poorly regulated issuers to opaque ownership structures.

## Conclusion: hype or new financial infrastructure?

Is RWA just another buzzword, or the foundation of a new financial stack?

The current picture looks like this:

- the market is still **relatively small**, but growing fast – from a few billion to tens of billions in just a few years;
- large incumbents like **Franklin Templeton** signal that this is not just a crypto fad, but a strategic move by traditional finance;
- regulators like **IOSCO** acknowledge the potential but loudly flag **legal, operational and market risks**;
- jurisdictions (US, EU, Hong Kong, mainland China) are already playing **regulatory ping-pong** over who gets to be an RWA hub.

For investors, a reasonable takeaway might be:

- **RWAs are not an “all-in” playground** – they are a field for cautious, well-researched experimentation;
- the upside is significant, but **until you truly understand what the token represents, you don’t know what you are risking**;
- if 2020 is remembered for DeFi and 2021 for NFTs, then 2024/2025 will probably be remembered as **the starting point of serious real-world asset tokenization**.

Whether RWAs become standard by 2030 or remain a pilot project for enthusiasts will depend less on technology and far more on **regulation, trust and how ready we are to genuinely connect traditional finance to open blockchain networks**.
