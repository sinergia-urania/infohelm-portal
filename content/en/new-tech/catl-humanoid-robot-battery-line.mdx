# CATL brings humanoid robots into battery-pack production: “Xiaomo” handles high-voltage connectors at scale

Humanoid robots have spent the last few years living in demo videos and viral clips. But seeing them on a real factory line — where every mistake costs money — is a different story.

China’s CATL (the world’s largest EV-battery maker) says it has started operating a battery-pack production line in Luoyang (Henan) that uses humanoid robots at scale. The headline act is **“Xiaomo”** (often translated as “Little Mo,” sometimes also written as “Moz” in reports), developed in collaboration with **Spirit AI Robotics**.

## What the robot actually does (and why it matters)

The point isn’t a humanoid walking around the shop floor — it’s taking over tasks that are:
- **risky** (high voltage, safety exposure),
- **highly repetitive** (fatigue leads to inconsistency),
- **precision-heavy** (misalignment means failed tests, defects, slowdowns).

CATL says Xiaomo robots handle critical steps such as **inserting/connecting high-voltage connectors** during battery-pack end-of-line testing. It’s one of those operations that looks simple until you realize it involves cable flex, tight tolerances, exact alignment, and basically zero room for error.

## “Embodied AI” in practice: a VLA model in a real environment

One interesting detail is the kind of “brain” mentioned around this story: a **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** model. In plain terms, that means the robot combines vision with contextual “understanding” to adjust its actions in real time — for example, correcting the grip or approach angle when a connector’s position varies slightly, without needing to reprogram every tiny change.

That’s a meaningful signal: manufacturing automation is moving beyond “a robot in a cage doing one thing forever,” toward systems that can handle small real-world variations and still stay reliable.

## The numbers everyone watches: 99% success and ~3× daily throughput (per CATL)

CATL claims the robot achieved around **99% success** on the connector task and delivered roughly **three times the daily output** compared to human work — largely because the robot can operate continuously.

Worth noting: these are company-reported figures, so treat them as directional rather than independently audited KPIs. Still, the direction is clear — factories are testing humanoids in the exact places where classic automation tends to have “blind spots.”

## Why a humanoid and not a traditional industrial robot?

Battery manufacturing already uses plenty of industrial robots. The potential advantage of a humanoid form factor (arms, reach, mobility, human-like access) shows up where:
- there are frequent variations in component position or geometry,
- the workspace isn’t perfectly engineered only for fixed robots,
- the task requires fine manipulation of cables and connectors.

In other words, humanoids aren’t automatically “better,” but they can be **more flexible** in the parts of the workflow that historically still needed people.

## What this could mean for the industry (and for end users)

If deployments like this prove stable at scale, the implications are straightforward:
- **safer** handling of high-voltage steps,
- **more consistent quality** and fewer defects,
- potentially **faster scaling** of battery-pack production.

Zooming out, this is also a milestone for “embodied AI”: it’s moving from labs into factories — first on tightly defined tasks, then gradually expanding.

## Conclusion

CATL’s Xiaomo rollout is a strong marker that humanoid robotics is shifting from PR to “does the job and moves the metrics.” We’re not in a world where humanoids replace everyone — but we are entering one where they take over the riskiest and most tedious steps first. And that’s usually how technology wins.
